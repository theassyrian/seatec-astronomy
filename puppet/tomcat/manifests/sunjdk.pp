# Class: tomcat::sunjdk

#   2010-08-05
#
#   This class models the Sun Java Development Kit in Puppet
#
#   Developed and tested on CentOS 5.5 i386 and x86_64
#   NOTE: It is difficult to uninstall the JDK.  Take a snapshot
#   before evaluating this class.
#
#   NOTE: JJM I recommend services requiring Java establish a relationship
#   with the Class["tomcat::sunjdk"] using a parameter to allow different
#   java runtime classes.
#
# Parameters:
#
# Actions:
#
#   Installs the Sun Java Development Kit and Java Runtime
#   /usr/bin/java
#
# Requires:
#
# Sample Usage:
#
#   include tomcat::sunjdk
#

# JJM Note, this installation is difficult to undo do to the nature of the Sun
# installer script.  It does not use the system packaging system, so removal
# is difficult and tedious.
# Snapshots are recommended for rollback if running in a Virtual Machine.
